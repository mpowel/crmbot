# CRM Bot Guide

Alfred knows you're very busy and in high demand, which is why he's offered to keep track of your contacts. He's still new, but eventually he'll be able to automatically store new contacts and start writing an email for you!

Sadly, however, at the moment he's only able to take down your contact's name, profession, email, and phone number.
